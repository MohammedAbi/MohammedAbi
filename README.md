# 💫 About Me
Hello!

I’m Mohammed Abdul Abi, a frontend developer nearly graduating with a Higher Professional Degree in Front-End Development from NorOff Education AS.

I hold a Master’s degree in Synthetic Organic Chemistry from the Norwegian University of Life Sciences in Ås, where I specialized in natural product synthesis.

My scientific background has sharpened my analytical thinking and problem-solving skills.

After completing my master's, I discovered my passion for frontend development.

Over the past two years, I have immersed myself in web design and programming, gradually building a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I am excited about the opportunity to learn from experienced teams and contribute to creating user-friendly web interfaces.

Let’s connect to discuss how I can grow and contribute to your organization while pursuing my passion for frontend development!
